<!-- Goals are: draw a map of the US, using LeafletJS -->
<!-- Make sure our page looks nice and map is an appropriate size -->
<!-- Use data from assignment to draw one bridge
icon for each of the 5 bridges  -->

<!--Empty div element. LeafletJS will draw the map inside this div -->
<!-- By  default, a div is 0 pixel tall, and as wide as the page -->
